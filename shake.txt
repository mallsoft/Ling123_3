ROSES their sharp spines being gone
Not royal in their smells alone
But in their hue
Maiden pinks of odour faint
Daisies smell-less yet most quaint
And sweet thyme true

Primrose firstborn child of Ver
Merry springtime 's harbinger
With her bells dim
Oxlips in their cradles growing
Marigolds on death-beds blowing
Larks heels trim

All dear Nature 's children sweet
Lie fore bride & bridegroom 's feet
Blessing their sense
Not an angel of the air
Bird melodious or bird fair
Be absent hence

The crow the slanderous cuckoo nor
The boding raven nor chough hoar
Nor chattering pye
May on our bride-house perch or sing
Or with them any discord bring
But from it fly
